<h3>Introduction.</h3>

<h5>Heavy-lifting is a method of using forms to record data in a systematic fashion.</h5> 

<p>In the engineering environment, there is a requirement to catalogue vast amounts of information. This information ranges from commercial contracts through to tables of bolts sizes. All of which would eventually be used for the reporting of data to a client or employer.  
The cataloguing of this data is currently contained in standards and specifications spread out across the globe. These specifications are generally controlled by standards bodies which in turn commercialize the documentation. This commercialization fundamentally impleads the growth of new industries and creates barriers to entry to globalization of trade. 
Included in this is vast amounts of duplication and erroneous mistakes that are not changes for years. </p>
<h5>Heavy-lifting aims to improve this through shared data control.</h5>
<p>At the core of the design of Heavy-lifting are the following considerations: </p>
<ul>
<li>Record changes in data over time</li>
<li>provide access to vast amounts of peer review information to all users</li>
<li>build component and assembly structures</li>
<li>have an open data structure which can be modular in nature</li>
</ul>

<h2>Heavy-lifting Installation Instructions</h2>
  
<p>In summary Heavy-lifting requires the following: </p>
<ul>

<h3>In more detail.</h3>

<h3>Arch Linux</h3>
<pre>
* Install NPM & MongoDB
* npm install -g nodemon
* Clone the repo

</pre>

<p>In more detail.</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1 - Install Node.js</li>
<pre>
Download and install from the Node.js homepage.
<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/en/</a>  
</pre>

<li>Step 2 - Install mongdb | follow the set up instructions on the website. (The trick is to create the c:/data/db directory then run mongod.exe). When in doubt the documentation on the site is very good.</li>

<pre>
Download and install from the mongodb homepage.
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">https://www.mongodb.com/</a>  
</pre>

<li>Step 3 - Sign up for Github , install the windows gihub client then clone the Heavy-lifting repository.</li>
<p>Clone the repository on your hard drive, using the "clone or download" button on the GitHub front page for Heavy-lifting.</p>
<p>Once downloaded, extract to the directory of your choice. For example: </p>

<pre>
C:\heavy-lifting
</pre>

<li>Step 4 - With node.js installed, the use of the NPM service is now available from your command prompt, go into the directory where heavy-lifting was cloned using your preferred command prompt (DOS interface). For example: </li>

<pre>
cd\heavy-lifting
</pre>
<p>When you are at the command prompt in the correct directory, type in the following:</p>

<pre>npm install npm@latest -g</pre> 

<p>
The NPM service will now download and install into the cloned directory. When completed , enter the following: 
</p>

<pre>npm install</pre>
 

<li>Step 5 - in order to bring in the favicon (tab icons) server, use the following at the command prompt to install the favicon module.
</li>
<pre>npm install serve-favicon</pre>


<li>• Step 6 - to make life much easier, install nodemon. Nodemon provides some welcome server management for troublesome server crashes , type into the cmd(command) prompt : 
</li>
<pre>npm install -g nodemon</pre>


<li>Step 7 - in order to communicate between the mongo server and the client side , expressjs needs to be installed. type into the cmd prompt 
</li>
<pre>npm install express</pre>

<li>Step 8 - the google recaptcha is from the following npom scource.
</li>
<pre>npm install express-recaptcha --save</pre>



<li>Step 8 - Robomongo is a very useful tool for viewing the mongodb database structure. Install from their website.
